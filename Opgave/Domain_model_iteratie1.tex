\item Time span:
\begin{itemize}
\item Actual start time
\item Actual end time
\item Calculate delay or assess estimated time
\item Timespan of tasks may overlap, unless dependency
\end{itemize}
\item Status:
\begin{itemize}

\item Ongoing: system makes estimate of when finished
\begin{itemize}
\item Based on: time of finished tasks
\item Estimate of duration of unfinished tasks
\begin{itemize}
